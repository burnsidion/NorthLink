Enable GitHub Copilot and Copilot Chat for this workspace

1. Open the Extensions pane in VS Code.
2. Install the recommended extensions: "GitHub Copilot" and "GitHub Copilot Chat".
3. After installation, sign in to GitHub when prompted.
4. If Copilot doesn't appear, open workspace settings and ensure `github.copilot.enable` and `github.copilot-chat.enable` are set to `true`.

If you want me to turn on anything else in the workspace, tell me which setting to add.
